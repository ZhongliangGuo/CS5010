## Notes

For the Lecture notes, they are taken by different guys. The authors are: **[Won](mailto:hwwnc1@st-andrews.ac.uk)** (Lecture 1, 2, 7), me (Lecture 4), **[Ethan](mailto:eh250@st-andrews.ac.uk)** (Lecture 5, 6), **[Rafael](mailto:rk81@st-andrews.ac.uk)** (Lecture 8, 9).

For the exam notes, they are all taken by me, written by latex (but I only share PDF).

## Coursework

Two assignments from Oggie and Lei.

The first one is an essay, I got 15/20

The second one is a report, I got 17/20

## Past Exam

Past exam. This year both two teachers are new. So the past exam papers do not have the value to refer.

## 2021 Exam

I uploaded both exam paper and my answer here.

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?(15+17)\div2\times0.6+0.4x=16.8)

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x=18)

So I got 18 in the exam paper.

The Learning part is provided by Oggie, the last question I have no ideas about that so I just searched it in textbook and CSDN. I cannot confirm that my answer is correct because I didn't fully understand it.

The rest of parts are from Lei. I think except question d of Uncertatinty, I provide the correct answer, but I'm not sure the digram in question d is correct and the pseudo code is clear enough.

Additional:

I did not read the question carefully... I thought the question would only change the type of coin once, but actually question ask to change twice... damn kill me pls...

## Final Score
Finally I got 16.8/20
