## Lectures

In this section, it is divided into two teachers' part, **[Oggie](mailto:oa7@st-andrews.ac.uk)** (Lecture 1 - 9) and **[Lei](mailto:lf28@st-andrews.ac.uk)** (Lecture 10 - 19).

I strongly recommend you watch Lei's Lecture, for Oggie's part, you can just read the notes (illustrate it later).

## Tutorials

In this section, Oggie didn't provide anything, all the tutorial materials provided by Lei.

Lei's tutorial is very very useful, must watch it!

## Notes

For the Lecture notes, they are taken by different guys. The authors are: **[Won](mailto:hwwnc1@st-andrews.ac.uk)** (Lecture 1, 2, 7), me (Lecture 4), **[Ethan](mailto:eh250@st-andrews.ac.uk)** (Lecture 5, 6), **[Rafael](mailto:rk81@st-andrews.ac.uk)** (Lecture 8, 9).

For the exam notes, they are all taken by me, written by latex (but I only share PDF).

## Coursework

Two assignments from Oggie and Lei.

The first one is an essay, I got 15/20 (but I think I deserve higher   ￣_￣   )

The second one is a report, its score has not released yet. I will update it

## Past Exam

Past exam. This year both two teachers are new. So the past exam papers do not have the value to refer.

## 2021 Exam

I uploaded both exam paper and my answer. I will update the score when it is available.
