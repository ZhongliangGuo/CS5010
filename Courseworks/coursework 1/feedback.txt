Summary: Decent submission with some weaknesses.


Style: All right in terms of rigour & academic tone and spirit (though could be improved); good use of references;

Language: Sentences all right in terms of clarity (though could have been improved); good terminology use; some linguistic problems throughout due to non-nativeness (n.b. for your benefit, did not affect the mark)

Argumentation: Reasonable conception of arguments and soundness of logic; the overall flow could have been better organized & different parts better connected and contextualized; a but unfocused attention w/ insufficient motivation of focus changes - you try to cover too many highly diverse topics and do not quite manage to get unified, binding flow right
